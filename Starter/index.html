<p class="leadGraph">Sol Garcia-Terrazas is a sophomore from Oakland, California, studying journalism at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism. She knew she wanted to go into journalism as a high school freshman, partly because of her uncle, who worked in the field. Watching his career, she saw journalism as both noble and rigorous, a space where curiosity and accountability meet. </p>

<p>Garcia-Terrazas was also shaped by her mother, an administrator and educator in the Oakland Unified School District. From her, she saw how dedication can impact communities every day, which strengthened her commitment to social justice and deepened her understanding of journalism's role in serving the public. </p>

<p> As a high school junior, she completed two mixed-media apprenticeships with a nonprofit serving underserved communities in Oakland. On the journalism track, she developed media literacy and reporting skills while learning how storytelling can empower communities. The experience convinced her that journalism is essential to civic engagement and that strong local reporting drives real change. </p>

<p> When she toured the University of Maryland, Garcia-Terrazas said she immediately connected with the Merrill College's focus on accountability and hands-on experience. She saw it as a place that would challenge her and expand her opportunities as a young reporter. </p>

<p>If given a superpower, Garcia-Terrazas would choose telepathy or invisibility, joking that it would make interviewing and investigative reporting easier. One thing she can't stand, however, is Brussels sprouts, which she describes as "horrid." </p>
